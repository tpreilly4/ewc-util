    STRING_SBD_DESCRIPTION: "The Smart Bypass Damper.\n\nNo measuring instruments are required. No weights to adjust. No springs to crank. The SBD is ACCA Manual Zr compliant. As an added benefit of the unique blade design and the smart, self-balancing feature of the SBD, there is no need to install and setup a separate bypass balancing hand damper.",
    STRING_CLBD_DESCRIPTION: "Due to the constant load applied to the damper blade and the unique magnetic latch, the CLBD Bypass Damper can be installed in any position on your bypass duct-work, to manage the HVAC system’s static pressure during zoned operations.\n\nThe CLBD minimizes bypass volume, while still preventing the HVAC system static pressure from rising above the selected Static Pressure set-point. The CLBD is a basic, cost effective Bypass Solution for Constant Speed or Variable Speed “zoned” HVAC systems.",
    STRING_PRD_DESCRIPTION: "Model PRD pressure regulating damper is a single blade, steel, barometric damper with a counter-balanced weighted arm. The PRD provides an economical solution for bypassing excess air when zone dampers close. Damper adjustment is done by adjusting the supplied weights and by offsetting the arm.",

    STRING_BMPLUS_DESCRIPTION:"Our 50% rule will inhibit second stage of heating or cooling based on the total number of zones calling. More than half of the total zones must be calling to enable second stage. If less than half are calling, the panel will not allow second stage to activate.\n\n" +
        "The intelligent design of the BMPlus does not require the use of a dual fuel kit to be compatible with a dual fuel heat pump. The BMPlus can be set to select staging based on an adjustable time delay or based on outside air temperature.\n\n" +
        "The adjustable stage timer of 5 min. to 47 min. allows single stage thermostats to control two stage systems and heat pumps. The same potentiometer adjusts between 5 F and 47 F for outside air changeover. The adjustable supply air sensor included with every panel is used to protect the equipment from inefficient airflow. The BMPlus provides three adjustable settings for this feature. The cooling limit adjusts between 34 F and 52 F. The first stage of heat adjusts between 110 F and 170 while the second stage of heat has a 5 F to 47 differential from the first stage setting. This allows the supply air sensor to be mounted in the supply plenum, regardless of the coil/heat exchanger configuration.\n\n" +
        "You can use any four-wire thermostat with either manual or automatic changeover. The BMPlus will accept the first call from any thermostat and turn on the appropriate heating or cooling equipment while simultaneously closing the dampers to the non-calling zones. When another thermostat calls for the opposite mode, that call is held until the original calling zone is satisfied or until the opposing system timer of 20 min. (factory set) has expired, whichever comes first. Once the call is satisfied all dampers will open and the system will shut down for four minutes. After four minutes the opposite mode will energize the system and close the dampers to the satisfied zones. The “one zone” mode allows for easy and quick thermostat set back programming. An active “one zone” mode converts the zoning system to a single zone, all controlled and activated from the Zone One thermostat. This feature ensures energy efficiency during non-occupied periods.",
    STRING_NCM300_DESCRIPTION: "The NCM 300 panel provides intelligent control of Heat Pump or Conventional forced air zoning systems at a maximum of three zones using motorized dampers and practically any off-the-shelf heat/cool thermostat.\n\n" +
        "With features like automatic changeover, opposite system service, short cycle timers and supply air sensing capability, the NCM 300 provides a high level of performance in a non-expandable zone control panel. Suitable for new construction and retro-fit applications.",

    STRING_LEARNMORE_CAPACITYCONTROL: "Capacity control, by itself, might reconcile an excess air problem. When this is not the case, capacity control is used with one or more relief strategies.
